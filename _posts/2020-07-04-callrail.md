>CallRail was in need of a full overhaul of there Wordpress marketing site. We set out to create a pattern library as the basis for creating the core components of the system.

>We needed to build this new system while simultaneously maintaining the old one. Because multiple departments depended on the old system we had to do this a way that was as least disruptive as possible.

>We started out using Jekyll as a proof of concept. We landed on a framework powered by VueJS for the core components. Static pages were created via Gridsome.

>An inventory of content proved we need to refocus around Google's proven Zero Moment of Truth.

>Then we set out to architect the information of the site as a whole.

>We then targeted SEO principles that we could build into the projects infrastructure.

>The data flows had been neglected and needed a bit of streamlining for various departments to make better decisions.

>We needed our feedback loop to be iterative and fast while looping in all the necessary stake-holders.

>We laid out the various controls, blocks, and patterns based on some current design iterations.

>This gave birth to a system of layers.

>The system needed to fit the way that users use the internet. Starting broad and moving to more specific. A user typically scans till they find something more long form they want to dive into.

>We mapped out tasks and put them into prospective roadmaps

>We designed a system for data flows to be symbiotic between the product and marketing departments.

![alt text](/assets/img/projects/callrail/callrail-17.png)

>We implemented a reverse proxy to split the traffic between the old and new systems.

>I was asked to coordinate various other data flow issues during my time at CallRail.

>Once these systems were mature it was trivial to bring rough concepts into reality in a very short period of time.

>The result was a system that could skip 90% of the design and development process. The system enables a junior developer to accomplish performant responsive designs based off rough sketches and deploy them into production with great ease.

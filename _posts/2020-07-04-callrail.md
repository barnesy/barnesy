>CallRail was in need of a full overhaul of their Wordpress marketing site, so I built and lead a team to accomplish this. We set out to create a pattern library as the basis for creating the core components of the system.

>We needed to build this new system while simultaneously maintaining the old one. Because multiple departments depended on the old system, we had to do this with as little disruption as possible.

>We started out using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as a proof of concept. We landed on a framework powered by [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) for the core components. Static pages were created via [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/).

>An inventory of content proved we needed to refocus around Google's proven [Zero Moment of Truth](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/micro-moments/zero-moment-truth/).

>Then we set out to architect the information of the site as a whole.

>We then targeted SEO principles that we could build into the project's infrastructure.

>The data flows had been neglected and needed streamlining for various departments to make better decisions.

>We needed our feedback loop to be iterative and fast while looping in all the necessary stakeholders.

>We laid out the various controls, blocks, and [patterns](https://ghost.ship.computer/pirates-code/patterns) based on current design iterations.

>This gave birth to a system of layers.

>The system needed to fit the way that users use the internet--starting broad and moving to more specific. A user typically scans until they find something more long form they want to dive into.

>We mapped out tasks and put them into prospective roadmaps.

>We designed a system for data flows to be symbiotic between the product and marketing departments.

![alt text](/assets/img/projects/callrail/callrail-17.png)

>We implemented a reverse proxy to split the traffic between the old and new systems.

>I was asked to coordinate various other data flow issues during my time at CallRail.

>Once these systems were mature, it was easy to bring rough concepts into reality in a very short period of time.

>The result was a system that could skip 90% of the design and development process. The system enables a junior developer to accomplish performant responsive web pages based off of rough sketches, and deploy them into production with great ease.

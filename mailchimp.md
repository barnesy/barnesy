Dear Hiring Manager,  

Being in the Atlanta tech scene, I’ve had many friends work at Mailchimp. I’ve watched the company grow to the impressive place it is today. The culture of creativity and innovation has always impressed me.

Over the past decade, I have been Lead Developer, CTO, and Co-Founder at several startups, playing many roles. These experiences have honed my skills of managing teams of people with diverse skill sets. I believe you can measure an engineering team’s strength by how quickly they create quality tech. However, any team can go through periods of drought if team members are getting burned out, road blocked, or confused. That’s why it is important to not only exceed project goals, but also to pay attention to the needs of each team member. As a people-oriented director I make great efforts to understand each member of my team and help them thrive in the ecosystem. In the past, I have had excellent success with not only project completion, but with employee retention. People like working with me.

As a Director of Engineering at Mailchimp, I would strive to create an atmosphere of clever solutions, creativity, and craft. Ensuring that my team has a clear target and an environment that fosters ingenuity and collaboration. I’ve always enjoyed running development teams and have a unique skill for bringing out the best work in others.

At my core I’m a people person and a creator of things. I’m always researching something new. I love to experiment with edge case technologies weather it’s a machine learning service or a new user experience paradigm. I often dream of interfaces. From creating a cryptocurrency mine in my garage to experimenting with virtual reality, there is a buzz in my brain for innovative problem solving. Whether paid or unpaid, my motivation in intrinsic. It is second nature for me to solve complex problems and bring new ideas into existence.

I believe that the success of a new technology is dependent on its ability to innovate and outpace the competition. For Mailchimp, this would largely depend on the effectiveness and strength of the engineering team. As a trailblazing, results-driven, and people-oriented Director, I would aim to make Mailchimp’s tech the best in its class.

Hope to see you soon,

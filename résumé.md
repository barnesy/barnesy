## Professional Experience  

#### Design Tech Lead at CallRail
##### (Dec 2018 – Present)  
I was hired to build out a development team for CallRail's marketing website and supporting technologies. Over the first year we focused on replacing the existing Wordpress website that had become bloated and overgrown with a streamlined modern framework. During my time at CallRail I hired and organized a highly functioning team of developers/designers, re-architected the entire marketing tech stack and data pipeline, and developed a pattern library to speed up the publishing and deployment of online content.

#### CTO/CEO at 4x4 Studios  
##### (2017 – Present)  
I started 4x4 to create a reading platform for families. The focus of 4x4 Studios is on family technology. We recently launched version 1.0 of our product on the App Store, which was featured by Apple in the "New Apps We Love" category.


#### CEO, Full Stack Engineer, UX Designer at DANIEL  
##### (Nov 2010 – Present)  
I created a client services business with a team of five Full-Stack Developers and two Designers. We built technology for Atlanta based startups and creative agencies such as Mohawk Flooring, IHG and Caterpillar. I had the privilege of helping 4 developers start their careers at DANIEL from scratch. Our beautiful babies went on to work at such companies as Razorfish, NCR, Deloitte and other creative agencies. Some started companies and became successful freelancers.

#### Senior Full-Stack Developer at The Supergroup
##### (2008 – 2010)  
I lead development on projects for Disney, Weather.com, and Kimberly Clark among others. One project won the once coveted “Favorite Website Award,” and was nominated for a Webby.  


#### Front End Developer at LogicBomb Media  
##### (2007 – 2008)  
I worked on Flash projects when it was the premier platform for the web...in other words, quite a while ago. Our most memorable project was a live video streaming site we did for a haunted house TV show.


#### Freelance Web Developer  
##### (2006 – 2008)  
I started taking small freelance projects in 2006. These were mostly local businesses. I created a portfolio of about 6 projects that paved the way for me to work in Atlanta.


#### Hobbies
- Painting with my kids.
- Pointing my telescope at things.
- Envisioning the future of tech.
- Spending hours in VR.
- Building drones.

Dear Mailchimp,

Being in the Atlanta tech scene, I’ve had many friends work at Mailchimp. The culture of creativity and innovation has always impressed me.

Over the past decade, I have been Lead Developer, Project Manager, CTO, and Co-Founder at several startups, playing many roles. These experiences have honed my skills of managing teams of people with diverse skill sets. I believe you can measure an engineering team’s strength by how quickly it creates quality tech. However, any team can go through periods of drought if team members are getting burned out, road blocked, or confused. As a people-oriented manager I make great efforts to understand each member of my team and help them thrive in the ecosystem. In the past, I have had excellent success with not only project completion, but with employee retention.

As a Senior Project Manager, I would strive to create an atmosphere of clever solutions, creativity, and craft. Ensuring that my team has a clear target and an environment that fosters ingenuity and collaboration. I’ve always enjoyed running development teams and have an affinity for bringing out the best work in others.

At DANIEL I had the privilege of helping 4 developers start their careers from scratch. Our beautiful babies went on to work at such companies as Razorfish, Deloitte, NCR and other creative agencies. Some started companies and became successful freelancers. My favorite thing to hear is the next steps they are taking in their careers.

I believe that the success of a new technology is dependent on its ability to innovate and outpace the competition. For Mailchimp, this would largely depend on the effectiveness and strength of the engineering team. I would aim to make Mailchimp’s tech the best in its class.

Hope to see you soon,



Chris Barnes
